# Approval Voting Guide for MakerDAO

Approval Voting is a form of voting that can be used to identify a consensus option among a group of voters. Voters may already be familiar with Approval Voting from Signal Requests on the Maker Forum.

The DUX Core Unit have recently added functionality for Approval Voting to the [voting portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/), allowing the use of Approval Voting for on-chain voting at MakerDAO.

Our Approval Voting implementation is flexible, it can be used to select a single winner, or multiple winners, depending on the question being asked. It can also be configured to require the winner(s) to receive majority support, or to declare the option with the most support the winner(s), regardless of whether or not a majority was obtained.

When voting on an Approval Vote, voters should select **all** options that they agree with. There is no penalty for selecting multiple options. However, it is legitimate to only vote for one option if there is only one option that the voter agrees with.

We have the option to stop people voting for the "Reject" options, as well as other poll options. The use case for this is limited and if this restriction is in place it will be clearly indicated in the poll text.

If you have any questions about Approval Voting please reach out to GovAlpha.
