# Introduction to voting in MakerDAO
MakerDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization whose governance process controls various aspects of the protocol. This guide is for anyone who wishes to participate in the governance process through voting.

Voting requires MKR tokens. MKR holders have the sole authority to enact changes to the system through voting. Off-chain voting takes place on the [Maker Forum](https://forum.makerdao.com) and on-chain voting takes place on the [Governance Portal](https://vote.makerdao.com/). 

Voting is calculated by a weighted voting system, where voting power is proportional to the amount of MKR tokens cast. For example, if 50 stakeholders hold a total of 600 MKR and vote for proposal A, while 100 stakeholders hold a total of 400 MKR and vote for proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of stakeholders who voted for a proposal does not change the result.
