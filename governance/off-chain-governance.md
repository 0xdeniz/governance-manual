# Off-Chain Governance

Off-chain governance supports on-chain governance by providing a process for gathering feedback prior to proposing on-chain votes and making decisions that don't require on-chain voting. In what follows the available means to conduct off-chain governance are described in increasing order of formality.

## Discussion

[Discussion](https://forum.makerdao.com/tags/c/governance/5/discussion) is the most informal, most free-form way of conducting off-chain governance. While discussing is a human universal and not specific to MakerDAO in any way, its power to effect change should not be underestimated. Discussions can be brought forth by anyone.

## Informal Polls

[Informal Polls](https://forum.makerdao.com/tags/c/governance/5/informal-poll) make use of the forum's support for poll creation. Informal Polls provide a set of options for the community to vote on. Although more structured than discussions, they cannot effect protocol changes nor trigger processes immediately. They are preeminently a social tool. Informal Polls can be created by anyone and there are no guidelines on the general use of Informal Polls other than courtesy and common sense.

Informal Polls can be used to:
- Measure community sentiment about issues affecting the MakerDAO ecosystem.
- Determine consensus that something needs to be done in response to a perceived issue.
- Determine consensus for a concrete action to be taken in response to a perceived issue.

## Signal Requests

Signal Requests are the most immediately powerful means of effecting change off-chain. Signal Requests are a type of poll whose specific parameters and necessity are established by processes that have been ratified within the MIPs Framework. The nature of the effects of Signal Requests can vary greatly in accordance to the MIP-ratified process that requires or allows Signal Requests.

>Before the passing of [MIP4c2-SP27](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP4c2SP27), Signal Requests could be initiated by anyone and needed not be triggered nor required by a ratified MIP process.
