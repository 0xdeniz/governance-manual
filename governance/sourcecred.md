# Off-chain Participation Incentives (SourceCred)

MakerDAO rewards off-chain participation in governance discussion on the official MakerDAO forum using SourceCred.

This page describes roughly how SourceCred operates within MakerDAO.

### The Rewards Pool

A pool of 2,500 DAI per week is allocated for distribution amongst active participants of the official MakerDAO forum.

This pool comes out of the GovAlpha Core Unit's budget.

### Cred Calculation

SourceCred calculates reputation for users on the MakerDAO forum (called 'Cred') based on positive interactions between members of the community. Positive interactions, likes, responses, quotes, etc - result in the author recieving Cred.

DAI is then allocated on a weekly basis according to two reward mechanisms.

#### Fast Mechanism

Allocates DAI based on proportional cred earned over the last few weeks - weighted heavily towards recent weeks. 

Allocates 1,875 DAI each week.

#### Slow Mechanism

Allocates DAI based on proportional cred earned over the last few months - weighted lightly towards recent weeks. 

Allocates 625 DAI each week.

### Payout Process

Participation rewards in DAI are calculated on a weekly basis, and paid out to opted-in users once a month. There is a minimum payout threshold of 50 DAI.

Compensation calculations are transparent and located here: MakerDAO SourceCred Instance.

Payouts are consolidated into a CSV file and distributed by GovAlpha from the GovAlpha multisig wallet.
