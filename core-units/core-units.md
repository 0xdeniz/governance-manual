## What is a Core Unit?

- A Core Unit is the basic building block for the DAO. Core Units define long-term work areas and cover a broad set of responsibilities or focus. They are the basic units of work that Maker Governance can oversee, manage and prioritize. They are proposed by community members and voted on by Maker Governance.
- Each Core Unit is responsible for achieving long-term objectives. Core Objectives and Domains are flexible concepts that emerge through the interaction of Core Units. Core Units are at the intersection of domains -(skill sets and capabilities) and objectives (cross-domain long-term workstreams.) A Core Unit can participate in multiple objectives and can fall under one or more domains.
- The Core Unit structure has a budget attached to it, managed by one or more Facilitators that coordinate and pay contributors working to achieve a long-term goal within MakerDAO. Each Core Unit may have a budget (MIP40). The Facilitators (MIP41) of a Core Unit may have additional permissions over the Maker Protocol or Governance Processes depending on their Core Unit's nature.
- The Core Unit Operating Model is the MIP Set that defines and structures Core Units. It contains MIP 38, MIP 39, MIP 40, and MIP 41.

## Mandate

- Core Unit Mandates set the direction of the work that Facilitators must help carry out by using their budget and exercising their Governance Powers.
- Mandates should be high-level and avoid micromanaging the Core Unit processes. Instead, they should be broad, open-ended, and give room for maneuver so as not to stifle the Facilitators' ability to develop innovative solutions and efficient processes. They can be regarded as "questions" for Facilitators to "answer" with their Facilitator Commitment (MIP41) when proposing to be on-boarded to a given Core Unit.
- Mandates from different Core Units can overlap to create redundancy, parallelizing and decentralizing work within the DAO and

## Budget

- Budgets are used to fund the work defined by the Core Units chosen by Maker Governance. A budget is attached to a Core Unit and is meant to be used only for that Core Unit.
- The Facilitators of each Core Unit administer Core Unit budgets. They must ensure that transparency and accountability exist as the budget is spent. If a Facilitator is off-boarded from their Core Unit, quits, or goes missing, the budget will continue to be available to pay out according to its Budget Implementation. This will al
- The [Budget Framework (MIP40)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP40) contains a framework for managing budgets and modifying them in the DAO Primitives State MIP. It allows Governance to manage and prioritize Core Units in a standardized way, promoting transparency. It aims to reduce Governance overhead, minimize abuse, and increase fairness in the budget process.
- The budget system gives Facilitators the flexibility to modify their plans away from the initially submitted budget breakdown if conditions change. If they need to allocate the money differently, this would be possible but never exceeding the aggregate amount defined by their Budget Implementation code. The Budget Framework can help Governance guide a given Core Unit. They could vote (or not) to attach multiple budgets to a Core Unit, each with a different, more specific objective.
- The components of a Core Unit Budget proposal are:
	- Budget Breakdown: It consists of the Core Unit Facilitators' best guess breakdown of spending for their Core Unit during the budget period.
	- Budget Implementation: It defines when and how the Core Unit Facilitators will receive the funds that make up their budget.

## Facilitator(s)

- A Facilitator is the most trusted actor in the MakerDAO community. They are given a high degree of autonomy and have resources and governance powers at their disposal.
- The [Facilitator Framework (MIP41)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP41) provides Governance with a simple way of managing and holding Facilitators accountable through the MIPs process.

## Tracking existing Core Units

- The [DAO Primitives States](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP38) allows users to track existing Core Units.
- This dataset lays a basic structure based on the [Core Unit Framework (MIP39)](https://mips.makerdao.com/mips/details/MIP39) capable of supporting the increasing complexity of the DAO and its continuous expansion. It documents and keeps track of the elements that make up the Core Unit structure and their dependencies.

## Submission Process: How do we propose a Core Unit?

- The process of proposing a new Core Unit or modifying an existing one is explained on MIP39c2:Adding/Modifying Core Units (Subproposal Process).
- The process for removing Core Units is explained on MIP39c3: Removing Core Units (Subproposal Process).
